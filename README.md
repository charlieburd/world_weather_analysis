# Module 5 - PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

#### Add the weather description to the weather data youâ€™ve already retrieved in this module. Have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Use the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
